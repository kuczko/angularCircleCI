      ## Pipeline section to be executed for each PR to master branch - as far as I see CircleCI is missing thie feature, but there must be possible workaround to just call have 
      ## custom webhook called on PR creation. If it is complicated, webhook may point at AWS Lambda which will then call CircleCI API
      ## Special goal is to ensure that code which will be in trunk branch works
